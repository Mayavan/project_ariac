* If you are someone who doesnâ€™t know how to use GitHub, then once go though this tutorials.[click here](https://try.github.io)
* Upload your code on your branch and **DON'T MERGE ANY BRANCH TO MASTER WITHOUT PEER-REVIEW!**
* Please try to follow [Google Cpp style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) so every one can understand the code!
* I belive we are gonna devlope whole final project on top of this project so try to use OOP as well as [CPP 14](https://github.com/AnthonyCalandra/modern-cpp-features).
